[Check it out](https://ropfoo.github.io/Simple-Count-Down/)

## How it works
Simply type in a costum count down durtation like '20m 15s' to start a timer running down to 0.

### Planned:
- [x] hours support
- [x] minutes support
- [ ] visual indicator when count down is at 0
- [x] replace dropdown with text input (e.g. '3m 20s')
- [ ] better visual error handling

### Bugs to fix:
- [x] 2 second jump on start
- [ ] input is not responsive
